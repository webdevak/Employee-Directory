# Employee Directory
 Awesome StartUp App,
Used the Random User Generator API, to grab information for 12 random “employees”, and I used that data to build a prototype employee directory. Requested a JSON object from the  API using fetch and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name opens a modal window with more detailed information, such as employee’s birthday and address. There is also a search bar to filter the directory by name.
Also Search functionality to filter through directory!
